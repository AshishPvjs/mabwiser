# Additional Experiments

## General Reproducibility Notebooks
- [Multivariate_Normal_Reproducibility notebook](Multivariate_Normal_Reproducibility.ipynb) shows the reproducibility issue with sampling from the multivariate normal distribution in general.
- [LinTS Minimal example](lints_minimal) shows the reproducibility issue with our minimal example in 5 different environments.

## Misc
- `example_ssh_config.json` shows the config necessary to run some of the experiments over ssh in the general reproducibility notebooks
- `utils.py` contains minor utilities for ensuring correctness

## Additional Experiments
- See [Goodreads](goodreads) folder for additional experimentation with Goodreads data.
- See [Synthetic Data](synthetic_data) folder for additional experimentation with a synthetic dataset.
